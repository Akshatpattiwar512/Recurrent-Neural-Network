# Recurrent-Neural-Network

###A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network in which node connections form a directed graph along a time sequence. As a result, it can display temporal dynamic behaviour. RNNs, which are derived from feedforward neural networks, can handle variable length sequences of inputs using their internal state (memory). As a result, they may be used for tasks like unsegmented, linked handwriting recognition or speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks are Turing complete in theory and may execute arbitrary algorithms to handle arbitrary sequences of inputs.
